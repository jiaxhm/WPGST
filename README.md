# WPGST: Wavelet Pooling Group Swin Transformer For Superpixel Segmentation

Our paper “WPGST: Wavelet Pooling Group Swin Transformer For Superpixel Segmentation” has been submitted to the International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing 2026 (ICASSP 2026).

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in su
perpixel segmentation. However, conventional CNNs mainly
 rely on local convolution and pooling operations, which lim
its their ability to capture global context and leads to fea
ture aliasing. To address these limitations, we propose the
 wavelet pooling group Swin Transformer (WPGST) for su
perpixel segmentation. First, a group Swin Transformer mod
ule is employed to capture both short- and long-range de
pendencies, while random convolution is applied to enhance
 inter-group interactions. Second, a wavelet pooling module
 is introduced to preserve essential feature information and
 mitigate feature degradation. Finally, a superpixel boundary
aware loss is designed to further improve spatial regularity.
 Experimental results on four datasets confirm that WPGST
 outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
