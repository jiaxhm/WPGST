# WPGST: Wavelet Pooling Group Swin Transformer For Superpixel Segmentation

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in superpixel segmentation. However, conventional CNNs mainly rely on local convolution and pooling operations, which limits their ability to capture global context and leads to feature aliasing. To address these limitations, we propose the wavelet pooling group Transformer (WPGT) for superpixel segmentation. First, a group Swin Transformer module is employed to capture both short- and long-range dependencies, while random convolution is applied to enhance inter-group interactions. Second, a wavelet pooling module is introduced to preserve essential feature information and mitigate feature degradation. Finally, a superpixel boundary-aware loss is designed to further improve spatial regularity. Experimental results on four datasets confirm that WPGT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
